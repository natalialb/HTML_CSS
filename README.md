Website homepage and email built using HTML and CSS through General Assembly short course. I started from a design put together in InDesign and Wireframe then built the structure in HTML and made it look good with CSS, making sure to add media queries for a fully responsive experience. 

Both are based on Blooming Good Coffee, an e-commerce website I created on Shopify https://bloominggood.co/ selling coffee makers & accessories. I wanted the design to be clear and easy to use while ensuring the design was unique.
